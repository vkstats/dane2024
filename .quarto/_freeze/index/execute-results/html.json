This workshop brings together leading researchers of the field of design and analysis of networked experiments. The aim is to enable in-depth discussions and initiate synergies between two dominant philosophies in networked experiments, optimal design and causal inference.\n\nThis workshop is in person and it is open to academic and industrial researchers/practitioners in the areas of design and analysis of experiments, casual inference, combinatorics and networks.\n\nThe conference is organised by [Dr Vasiliki Koutra](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/vasiliki-koutra).\n\n## Keynote speakers\n\n - Dr Dean Eckles (MIT)\n\n - Dr Alexander Volfovsky (Duke University)\n\n - Professor Rosemary Bailey (University of St Andrews)\n\n - Dr Nathaniel Stevens (University of Waterloo)\n\n## Sponsors\n\n\n::: {layout=\"[[1,1], [1,1]]\"}\n![](images/icms.png)\n\n![](images/Kings.png)\n\n![](images/EPSRC.png)\n\n![](images/lms.png)\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\nThis workshop is supported by the London Mathematical Society. LMS believes that all parents working in mathematics should be able to attend conferences/research meetings without being hindered by childcare costs and thereby administers a Childcare Supplementary Grant Scheme. Further information about this scheme can be found on the LMS website: <http://www.lms.ac.uk/content/childcare-supplementary-grants>\n\n",
