    "text": "About\nDesign and analysis of networked experiments is a novel area of research which finds practical use in most research disciplines, medical trials and industrial settings that involve connected experimental units. This workshop brings together leading researchers of the field of design and analysis of networked experiments. The aim is to enable in-depth discussions and initiate synergies between two dominant philosophies in networked experiments, optimal design and causal inference.\nThis workshop is in person and it is open to academic and industrial researchers/practitioners in the areas of design and analysis of experiments, casual inference, combinatorics and networks.\nThe conference is organised by Dr Vasiliki Koutra."

This is true of companies like LinkedIn, Facebook, and X, large online social networks. However, experiments on networks are complicated by the fact that the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) no longer holds. Due to the interconnectivity of users in these networks, a user’s outcome may be influenced by their own treatment assignment as well as the treatment assignment of those they are socially connected with. The design and analysis of the experiment must account for this. The general additive network effect (GANE) family of models is proposed to jointly and flexibly model treatment and network effects. Experimental design and analysis considerations are discussed in the context of the proposed family of models.\nCollaborators:\n\nTrang Bui (University of Waterloo)\nStefan Steiner(University of Waterloo)\n\n\n    14:30 - 15.00\nTea\n\n\n\n    15:00 - 17:00\nInvited session 1\n\n\n\n    \nAlessio Zanga\nUniversity of Milano - Bicocca\nFederated Causal Discovery with Missing Data in a Multicentric Study on Endometrial Cancer\nCausal discovery is the task of learning a causal graph representing the cause-effect relationships. Being able to establish causal dependencies is crucial in several applied domains, especially when the decision-making policy needs to be explainable, as in the case of medicine and healthcare. In these settings, small sample size and missing data call for federated approaches to take advantage of the information distributed across multiple sources. In this work, we introduce a novel federated causal discovery algorithm capable of pooling together information from multiple sources with heterogeneous missing data distributions. In particular, we propose a score-based approach that learns a global causal graph while taking into account local missingness mechanisms and prior knowledge. We applied the proposed algorithm on a real-world multicentric study on endometrial cancer, validating the obtained causal graph through quantitative analyses and clinical literature. The federated methodology showed promising results in recovering the underlying causal graph, especially in the presence of data missing not at random.\n\n    \nKirsten Schorning\nTechnische Universitt Dortmund\nOptimal Designs for state estimation in electricity networks\n\n    \nBen Parker\nBrunel University\nDesign of Experiments for autoregressive networks\n\n    17:00\nClose of the day\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    09:30-10:30\nKeynote 3\n\n\n\n    \nAlexander Volfovsky\nDuke University\n Neighborhood Adaptive Estimators for Causal Inference under Network Interference\n\n    10:30-11:00\nCoffee\n\n\n\n    11:00-12:30\nInvited industry session\n\n\n\n    \nEleni Kalfountzou\nProcter & Gamble\nExperimentation in the FMCG industry - when A/B testing is not enough\n\n    \nLorenzo Masoero\nAmazon\n\n\n    12:30-14:00\nLunch\n\n\n\n    14:00-15:20\nInvited session 2\n\n\n\n    \nTim Waite\nUniversity of Manchester\nSequential Bayesian design with Laplace-parameterized policies\nIn the past few years policy-based approaches have been developed as a method for sequential Bayesian design, building on ideas from dynamic programming and deep reinforcement learning. The idea is to construct in advance a policy, i.e. a mapping from the current knowledge state to the next set of experimental conditions at which to observe a response. This policy is to be constructed in such a way as to maximize the ultimate expected utility, e.g. the expected Shannon information gain, after all experiments have been completed. This is usually done by taking the policy to be a neural network, and optimizing its weights. However, a key question in policy-based approaches is how to represent the knowledge state, i.e. what to use as the input to the policy network. It is clear the knowledge state is completely specified by the posterior distribution, and so an attractive choice would be an approximation to the posterior, especially one with only a few parameters which could then serve as inputs to the policy network. In this talk we discuss the use of the Laplace approximation to the posterior as the knowledge representation, and develop the methodology needed to train policies based on Laplace representations. \n\n    \nWerner Müller\nJohannes Kepler University Linz\nA practical guide to optimal design of experiments under correlation\n\n    \nBen Parker\nBrunel University\nDesign of Experiments for autoregressive networks\n\n    15:20-16:00\nTea\n\n\n\n    16:00-17:00\nPanel discussion\nThe future of networked experiments\n\n\n    \nChair: Steve Gilmour\nKing's College London\n\nPanelists: Dean Eckles, Nathaniel Stevens, Alexander Volfovsky, Eleni Kalfountzou, Lorenzo Masoero, Rosemary Bailey\n\n    17:00-18:00\nReception\n\n\n\n    18:00\nClose of the day\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    09:30-10:30\nKeynote 4\n\n\n\n    \nRosemary Bailey\nUniversity of St Andrews\nDesigns on strongly-regular graphs\nMost networks can be regarded as graphs.  Some particularly nice graphs are the strongly-regular graphs.  The edges and non-edges of such graphs form the\nassociate classes of an association scheme.  The corresponding Bose-Mesner algebra\n(linear combinations of the adjacency matrices) has three common eigenspaces, one of which consists of the constant vectors.\nIn classical work on design of experiments, the experimental units are grouped into \\(b\\) blocks of size \\(k\\). There are three common eigenspaces. One consists of the constant vectors (it has dimension \\(1\\)); one consists of vectors which are constant on each block and whose entries sum to zero (it has dimension \\(b-1\\); the third is the orthogonal complement of these two (it has dimension \\(b(k-1)\\).\nIn some experiments, the experimental units are all pairs of individuals who have to undertake a given task together. If all such pairs are used exactly once each, then the set of pairs forms a triangular association scheme. If there are \\(n\\) individuals then there are \\(N = n(n − 1)/2\\) such pairs. The corresponding Bose–Mesner algebra has three common eigenspaces. One consists of the constant vectors (it has dimension \\(1\\));\none consists of linear combinations of the indicator vectors of individuals, constrained so that the entries sum to zero (it has dimension \\(n−1\\)); the third is the orthogonal complement of these two (it has dimension \\(N − n\\)).\nIn both cases, we assume that the variance–covariance matrix \\(C\\) of the responses to the experiment is an unknown linear combination of the matrices of projection onto these eigenspaces.\nTwo types of block design are particularly important. In balanced block designs, the variance of the estimated difference between any two treatments is the same, no matter what the eigenvalues of \\(C\\) are. In orthogonal block designs, the linear combination of responses which gives the best unbiased estimator of any difference between treatments does not depend on what the eigenvalues of \\(C\\) are. Such designs are often said to have commutative orthogonal block structure.\nIn this talk I will give some constructions for balanced designs and some for designs\nwhich have commutative orthogonal block structure, in each scenario.\nThis is joint work with P.

After introducing the general graphex framework and its asymptotic properties, I will explain how we model sparse networks embedded in a latent space and use this framework to uncover structures underlying mobility patterns.
